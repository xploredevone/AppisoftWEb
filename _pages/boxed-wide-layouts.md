Wide layout is perfect for you, if you like airy websites, with no visible borders or page edges. Boxed layout comes with different ready-to-use background patterns &amp; images, or you can define any color you would like to use by simply picking it with Scalia's colorpicker.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
